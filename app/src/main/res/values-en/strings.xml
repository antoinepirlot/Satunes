    <string name="android_auto_tuto">To activate Android Auto you must carry out the following steps:\n\n1) Go to Android Auto settings.\n\n2) Multiple click on \"Version\" to activate dev mode.\n\n3) Go to Dev\'s settings and activate \"Unknown sources\" as this app is not published on Google Play Store.\n\n4) Click on the 3 buttons as in point 3, but click on \"Exit developer mode\" the setting you just activated will be saved.\n\n5) Add app in launcher.\n\n6) Enjoy</string>

    <string name="audio_offload_info">This parameter allows you to send audio treatment to a dedicated process.\nThis reduces energy consumption.\n\nHowever, in the Media 3 library used in Satunes, this can cause compatibility issues which results in audio cuts. A known issue is that the music is stopping during playback or after the end of a song.\n\nBy activating this parameter, you reduce energy consumption and increase the  battery life but you are likely to meet audio cuts.\n\nI hope that in a nearby future, the problem will be resolved by Google which holds the Media3 and Exoplayer libraries. In the meantime, I try to find viable solutions to reduce energy consumption by Satunes.</string>
