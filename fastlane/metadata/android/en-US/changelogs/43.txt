Improvements, optimizations and troubleshooting:

* It is no longer possible to have 2 different playlists with the same name regardless of the upper/lower case
* Blank strings are removed from playlist title when added or updated.
* When launching playback via searches with shuffle mode, the selected music is the first in the queue
* When searching, if the first or last characters are spaces, they are ignored
