New features:

* Ability to sort media by artist, album and/or genre based on page
* Display of the first letter in alphabetical order above the first media (with this letter) in the
  list (can be disabled in library settings)
* Added sorting by year and last added for music (in some views at the moment)
* Adding media to playlists now removes them if they are present (entirely for those who are not
  music)
* It's possible to move custom actions positions
